@phdthesis{Elsinga,
    abstract = {{Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry is a new experimental method developed to study three-dimensional motion in turbulent flows. The technique is an extension of standard PIV and makes use of several simultaneous views of illuminated tracer particles and their three-dimensional reconstruction as a light intensity distribution by means of tomography. The reconstructed tomogram pair is then analyzed by means of 3D cross-correlation returning the three-component velocity vector distribution over the measurement volume. The principles and details of the tomographic algorithm are discussed and a parametric study is carried out by to identify the most important parameters governing the experimental setup and to show their effect on the reconstruction accuracy. The capability of the technique in real experimental conditions is assessed with the measurement of the turbulent flow in the near wake of a circular cylinder.Next, this new technique has been applied to study the three-dimensional coherent structures in turbulent boundary layers. Quantitative visualizations of the individual (hairpin) vortices as well as the large-scale structures in both a low speed turbulent boundary layer and a high Reynolds number supersonic boundary layer have been obtained. The high Reynolds number data also suggests a very-large-scale flow organization exists not only in streamwise direction but also in spanwise direction. These very-large scale motions appear to consist of large-scale hairpins, which display a preferential alignment in streamwise direction and in the spanwise direction along the 45 degrees diagonal with the respect to the streamwise direction. Moreover, the time evolution of the flow structures is visualized in an experiment, in which the Tomographic-PIV technique is applied to nearly time-resolved image sequences recorded at 1.5 kHz.}},

    author = {C. Bordage},
    abstract = {{The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is considered as one of the top ten algorithms of the 20th century. The FMM can speed up solving of electromagnetic scattering problems. With N being the number of unknowns, the complexity usually O(N 2) becomes O(N log N ) allowing a problem with hundreds of millions of complex unknowns to be solved. The FMM applied in our context has a serious drawback: the parallel version is not very scalable. In this paper, we present a new approach in order to overcome this limit. We use StarPU, a runtime system for heterogeneous multicore architectures. Thus, our aim is to have good efficiency on a cluster with hundreds of CPUs, and GPUs. Much work have been done on parallelization with advanced distribution techniques but never with such a runtime system. StarPU is very useful, especially for the multi-level algorithm on a hybrid machine. At present, we have developed a multi-core and a GPU version. The techniques for distributing and grouping the data are detailed in this paper. The first results of the strategy used are promising.}},
