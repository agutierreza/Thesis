volume="66",
number="1",
pages="135--147",
abstract="This paper presents a new Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tool to compute the optimal solar-panel positioning maps on large high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). In particular, this software finds out (1) the maximum solar energy input that can be captured on a surface located at a specific height on each point of the DEM, and then (2) the optimal tilt and orientation that allow capturing this amount of energy. The radiation and horizon algorithms we developed in previous works were used as baseline for this tool (Romero et al. in Comput. Phys. Commun. 178(11):800--808, 2008; Tabik et al. in Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Sci. 25(4):541--555, 2011). A multi-method approach is analyzed to make the hybrid implementation of this tool especially appropriate for heterogeneous multicore-GPU architectures. The experimental results show a high numerical accuracy with a linear scalability.",

    abstract = {This paper describes and analyses a Stochastic Programming ({SP}) model that is used for a specific inventory control problem for a perishable product. The decision maker is confronted with a non-stationary random demand for a fixed shelf life product and wants to make an ordering plan for a finite horizon that satisfies a service level constraint. In literature several approaches have been described to generate approximate solutions. The question dealt with here is whether exact approaches can be developed that generate solutions up to a guaranteed accuracy. Specifically, we look into the implications of a Stochastic Dynamic Programming ({SDP}) approach.},

In this paper, we present a method to determine dynamic order quantities for perishable products with limited shelf-life, positive lead time, {FIFO} or {LIFO} issuing policy, and multiple service level constraints. In a numerical study, we illustrate the superiority of the proposed method over commonly suggested order-up-to-policies. We show that a constant-order policy might provide good results under stationary demand, short shelf-life, and {LIFO} inventory depletion.},

    abstract = {Over the years, several companies have emerged as exemplary of  {\"\i}?`� best practices{\"\i}?`� in supply chain management; for example, {Wal-Mart} is frequently cited as using unique strategies to lead its market. One significant challenge for {Wal-Mart} is managing inventories of products that frequently outdate: A significant portion of {Wal-Mart}'s product portfolio consists of perishable products such as food items (varying from fresh produce to dairy to bakery products), pharmaceuticals (e.g., drugs, vitamins, cosmetics), chemicals (e.g., household cleaning products), and cut flowers. {Wal-Mart}'s supply chain is not alone in its exposure to outdating risks {\"\i}?`� to better appreciate the impact of perishability and outdating in society at large, consider these figures: In a 2003 survey, overall unsalable costs at distributors to supermarkets and drug stores in consumer packaged goods alone were estimated at \$2.57 billion, and 22\% of these costs, over 500 million dollars, were due to expiration in only the branded segment (Grocery Manufacturers of America 2004). In the produce sector, the \$1.7 billion {US} apple industry is estimated to lose \$300 million annually to spoilage (Webb 2006). Note also that perishability and outdating are a concern not only for these consumer goods, but for industrial products (for instance, Chen (2006), mentions that adhesive materials used for plywood lose strength within 7 days of production), military ordnance, and blood {\"\i}?`� one of the most critical resources in health care supply chains. According to a nationwide survey on blood collection and utilization, 5.8\% of all components of blood processed for transfusion were outdated in 2004 in the {USA} ({AABB} 2005).},

The model is presented as a bi-level problem. On the first (tactical) level, decisions are made on the fleet composition for a certain time horizon. On the second (operational) level, the fleet is used to optimise the schedule of operations needed at the OWF, given events of failures and weather conditions. "
